    "Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the users and used to describe things in simple terms. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity."

A user does not need to know how these features work or how the car's internal mechanism is functioning to use the car. the user only needs to know how to operate the car and make it go where they want. this is an example of abstraction in action, as the user only interacts with the relevant features of the car and not the internal mechanisms of how the car works."

    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features to the users. In other words, it focuses on the 'what' of a system rather than the 'how'. Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantied but can be inherited by other classes. it can contain both abstract and concrete methods. An abstract method is a method that does not have an implementation in the abstract class but must be implemented in the child class. An interface is a collection of abstract methods that define a contract for implementing classes."
